To run the IMAP application, two external packages are required (tKinter and IMAPClient)
To install these perform the following commands in terminal

sudo apt-get install python-tk
sudo pip install IMAPClient

Once these are installed the application can be opened via the GUI_Init.py file
in the src directory.

The GUI currently does not match the CLI in features, but it is much easier to use.

Commands available for use in the CLI include(Commands are case sensitive):
	Folders Menu:
		choose_folder
		create_folder
		delete_folder
	Message Menu:
		list
		read
		read all
		create
		copy
		delete
		move
		set flag
		remove flag
		search
		logout

Many of these commands will prompt you for further input.
